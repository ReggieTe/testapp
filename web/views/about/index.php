                               <h3>Do you have to become a victim to take action</h3> 
                               <p><b>No</b> that is the answer our founders  took when they got tired of seeming endless posts on social media of missing people ,people who are lost and 
                               disorientated trying to reconnect with their loved ones,Not forgeting people being defrauded of hard earned money by know fraudsters in other communities .<br><br>With a background in software developement they took upon themselves to find ways on how to 
                               better the process of reconnecting , notifying and alerting the community </p> 

                               <h4>Reconnecting</h4>
                               <p>The process of connecting people with their loved ones must not be a nightmare  but a seamless process with the help of the communities ending in either tears or joy or closure for the family</p>
                              <h4>Notifying</h4>
                              <p>When someone goes missing it will not only take the effort of the family but the effort of the community to bring them back,hence everyone is the community must be able to be notified on the go because every minute counts</p>
                              <h4>Alerting</h4>
                              <p>Fraudsters and criminals move from community to community to pounce on unsuspecting victims either to cause bodily or finanical harm.So with an effective system to track using their photos and help the police to apprehend the suspects, we not only save communities but also families </p>
                        </div>
                        <h4><b>Dedication</b></h4>
